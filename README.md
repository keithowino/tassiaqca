## Overview

tassiaQCA is a community-centric e-commerce and business discovery platform built specifically for the Tassia Complex in Embakasi, Nairobi. As local entrepreneurship continues to grow, many small businesses still struggle with digital visibility while residents often miss nearby products and services.

tassiaQCA bridges this gap by creating a centralized local marketplace where businesses can showcase their offerings and community members can discover, shop, and engage with nearby vendors—all in one place.

### The Problem

Small businesses struggle with online visibility, while residents waste time searching for trusted local services and products.

### The Solution

A digital community marketplace where local businesses can list products and services, and residents can discover, order, review, and connect with nearby merchants.
